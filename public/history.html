			<h1>History of the Institute</h1><br>
			<p>The founder President/ Chairperson Late. Mrs. Ravinder Kaur alias Mrs. Raj Parmar envisaged a mission to start an Institute of technical training in the backward area of Punjab. From the training part, after deep delibrations, it was decided to start an industrial training institute which was the need of the hour to create technically trained craftsmen to meet the potential demand of such workforce in the economically and technically developing state of Punjab, which had achieved its supremacy in the field of agriculture in the country.<br><br> The location of the proposed ITI was identified at Mahilpur which is partly urban and partly rural having a notified area committee. It is situated in the midst of the most backward area of Punjab. It is situated adjacent to the Kandi Area of Punjab and in the vicinity of the foothills of Shivalik range. To achieve this goal a trust was constituted bearing   the name of National Education Trust. It was duly got regd. also.<br><br> Thus the institute is running under the aegis of National Education Trust (Regd.). The trust Comprises of educationists, doctors, engineers and administrators of great acumen and expertise in their respective fields. The institute is situated at Mahilpur, a town having both urban and rural environments. The pollution free surroundings give an impetus to pursue the learning and training in an ideal location. Special attention is paid to discipline, punctuality and commitment to Train and Learn. Following this principle, the institute has established its name & fame in wide length and breadth of Punjab. The staff drawn from the concerned fields is well experienced and dedicated to impart the best of training and knowledge. <br><br>The institute is well equipped with all the machinery, equipment and tools as per norms laid down by DGET New Delhi.
